A collaborative IPv6 book.

The intention is a practical introduction to IPv6 for technical people, kept up to date by active practitioners.

The book will be available free of charge (and free of advertising) on-line, possibly with an option to obtain a printed copy at cost price.

This GitHub repository is a starting point. It may be replaced by a differently structured repo as the work progresses and we gain experience of how to do it.

You can start reading the book [here](Contents.md). It is a work in progress, and if you want to contribute, start [here](CONTRIBUTING.md).

You can download a pre-release PDF of the whole book [here](https://github.com/becarpenter/book6/blob/main/pdf/baked.pdf), and a pre-release ePub version [here](https://github.com/becarpenter/book6/blob/main/pdf/baked.epub).
(On those pages, use the little "download" button <img src="./download.png" width="20px" height="auto"> at the top right.)
