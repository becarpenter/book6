## How to use this book

This book is, and we hope always will be, a work in progress. It is
intended for people who plan, deploy, maintain and operate computer
networks using Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6). It is being written
and updated by exactly such people. IPv6 is a mature protocol but every
day we gain more experience, products are updated, and quite often the
underlying technical standards are updated too. Therefore, this book
will likewise be constantly updated. It's issued under an
[open source license](https://github.com/becarpenter/book6/blob/main/LICENSE.md).
You are welcome to make a printed copy at your own expense, but be aware
that the book will evolve constantly.

The [list of contents](../Contents.md) should act as an on-line guide to
the topics covered. Most readers will probably not read from cover to
cover. Design your own path through the book.

There is also an [index](../Index.md).

A little tip if you are reading this on GitHub: For some reason, GitHub
doesn't support automatically opening a link in a new browser tab or
window, so clicking on links will always take you away from the current
page. To avoid this, with most browsers you can use CTRL+click (on
Windows and Linux) or CMD+click (on MacOS) to open a new tab.

You can download a pre-release PDF of the whole book [here](https://github.com/becarpenter/book6/blob/main/pdf/baked.pdf), and a pre-release ePub version [here](https://github.com/becarpenter/book6/blob/main/pdf/baked.epub).
(On those pages, use the little "download" button <img src="./download.png" width="24px" height="auto"> at the top right.)
