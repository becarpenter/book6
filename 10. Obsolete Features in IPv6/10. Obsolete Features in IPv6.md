# Obsolete Features in IPv6

This chapter lists a number of IPv6 features that can be considered
obsolete or unused, even if in some cases the relevant RFCs have not
been formally obsoleted. Readers are advised to ignore these techniques
for new deployments, and to consider removing them from existing
deployments.

## Mobile IPv6

Mobile IPv6 was a technology that was baked into the IPv6 protocol very
early in its development. However based on zero implementations the
technology exists only in textbooks and IETF standards. Since there are
no current implementations and current standards are extremely stale,
Mobile IPv6 is effectively obsolete and should not be taught in training
or mentioned as part of the IPv6 feature set. Below are a listing of
those IETF standards:

- [RFC 6275](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6275.html) - Mobility
  Support in IPv6 was last updated in 2011. It is the primary standard
  that covers basic operation, security functions, mobility operations,
  and packet structure.
- [RFC 4283](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4283.html) - Mobile Node
  Identifier Option for Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) was last updated in 2005. It
  primarily covers all the functions of the Mobility Header and it was
  essential to have a mechanism wherein mobility entities can be
  identified using other identifiers.
- [RFC 4285](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc4285) Authentication
  Protocol for Mobile IPv6 was last updated in 2006. This was the
  solution for securing the Binding Update and Binding Acknowledgment
  messages between the Mobile Node and Home Agent using a mobility
  message authentication option that is included in these messages

## Site-Local Unicast Addressing

Site-local unicast addressing has an odd place in IPv6. It was originally
proposed to provide private IPv6 addressing, similar to
[RFC 1918](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1918.html). Site-local
addressing was orginally defined for this special use in Section 2.5.6 of
[RFC 3513](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3513.html#section-2.5.6).
Problems quickly arose for the following reasons:

- ambiguity of addresses, meaning an address such as `fec0::1` can be
  present in multiple sites, and the address itself does not contain any
  indication of the site to which it belongs. This creates pain for
  developers of applications, for the designers of routers and for the
  network managers.
- fuzzy definition of sites combined with the ambiguity of addressing
  means that if sites are merged (e.g., when two companies merge) or
  otherwise cross-routed, either
  1. hosts must be renumbered, or
  2. a zone identifier must be added to distinguish the nodes, e.g.,
  `fec0::1234:5678:9abc%1`. This would require non-existent software
  and operational support.

### Deprecated but Not Gone

Site-local addresses were soon deprecated by
[RFC 3879](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3879).
However, even with this deprecation, traces remain in documents and
have caused significant confusion.
[RFC 4291](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4291.html#section-2.5.7)
mentions this deprecation.

- RFC 3879 also states that the prefix fec0::/10
  "MUST NOT be reassigned for other use except by a future IETF
  standards action." Given that, it cannot be reabsorbed into the IANA
  Global Unicast address space.
- It is also listed as a separate prefix in the IPv6 Prefix Policy Table
  outlined in [RFC 6724](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6724.html)
  with label 11 and precedence 1.
- RFC 3879 and RFC 4291 both state that existing implementations and deployments
  may continue to use the site-local prefix.

Despite this, site-local unicast addressing is effectively obsolete and
should not be taught in training or mentioned as part of the IPv6
feature set.

## Other obsolete addresses

Several obsolete address types are listed at the end of
[2. Addresses](../02.%20IPv6%20Basic%20Technology/Addresses.md).

## The problem of extension headers

Adding new extension headers, including new hop-by-hop
options, has proved very hard in practice, since
security and denial-of-service concerns mean that they
are often blocked at network boundaries. They also make it
difficult for technologies such as load balancers to rapidly
identify the transport header in a packet.

In particular, Router Alert has been deprecated for future protocols
  \[[RFC9805](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc9805)\].

## Secure Neighbor Discovery (SeND)

SeND \[[RFC3971](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc3971)\]
\[[RFC6494](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc6494)\]
\[[RFC6495](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc6495)\]
\[[RFC6980](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc6980)\]
is hardly deployed because of its complexity and lack of adequate
implementations. Instead, operators tend 
to deploy Router Advertisement Guard
\[[RFC6105](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc6105)\]
\[[RFC7113](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc7113)\].

## Coexistence

Older IPv4/IPv6 coexistence mechanisms are described in
[3. Obsolete techniques](../03.%20Coexistence%20with%20Legacy%20IPv4/Obsolete%20techniques.md).
