## Dual stack scenarios

We must distinguish the original model of dual stack deployment from the
new concept of presenting a dual stack to the upper layer protocols
while providing IPv4 as a *service* over an IPv6 infrastructure.

### Original dual stack model

Dual-Stack was originally described (along with basic tunneling) in
[RFC4213](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4213). In 2020, it appeared
to be the most widely deployed IPv6 solution (about 50%, see the
statistics reported in
[ETSI-IP6-WhitePaper](https://www.etsi.org/images/files/ETSIWhitePapers/etsi_WP35_IPv6_Best_Practices_Benefits_Transition_Challenges_and_the_Way_Forward.pdf)).

In a classical dual stack deployment, packets on the link are either
native IPv6 or native IPv4. All routers support IPv6 and IPv4
simultaneously, with separate routing tables: this is known as "ships in
the night".

```
Ships that pass in the night, and speak [to] each other in passing,
only a signal shown, and a distant voice in the darkness
  --  Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, 1863
```

Today, the core of the Internet - all the major international transit
providers and all major Internet Exchange Points - support dual stack
routing. So do many local ISPs.

Also, all hosts in a dual stack network should support IPv6 and IPv4
simultaneously, with IPv6 preferred. Such a deployment can tolerate the
presence of legacy IPv4-only hosts and applications, and can reach
external IPv4-only services, with no special arrangements. An essential
part of this model is that applications using the network see a version
of the socket API that intrinsically supports both IPv4 and IPv6. Thus,
\[[RFC3542](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc3542)\] introduced a
dual-stack API, including the important `getaddrinfo()` ("get address
information") function, which has since been adopted by both POSIX and
Windows operating systems.

[RFC8305](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc8305) explains the "Happy
Eyeballs" technique for applications seeking to optimize dual-stack
performance.

With Dual-Stack, IPv6 can be introduced together with other network
upgrades and many parts of network management and Information Technology
(IT) systems can still work in IPv4. As a matter of fact, IPv4
reachability can be provided for a long time and most Internet Service
Providers (ISPs) are leveraging Carrier-Grade NAT (CGN,
[RFC6888](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc6888)) to extend the life
of IPv4. However, large ISPs have discovered the scaling limits and
operational costs of CGN.

A gap in this classical dual stack approach is that it does not allow an
IPv6-only client to communicate with an IPv4-only server. IPv6-only
devices do exist, e.g.
[Thread](https://www.threadgroup.org/What-is-Thread/Overview) devices,
and more are to be expected in future. This situation requires a
translation mechanism, such as NAT64 + DNS64 (see
\[[Translation and IPv4 as a service](Translation%20and%20IPv4%20as%20a%20service.md)\]), which will allow IPv6 only devices,
on a dual stack network, to access IPv4 hosts. Typically, dual stack
clients on the same network will also use NAT64 (instead of
[RFC1918](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc1918) addresses and NAT44)
to access IPv4 only hosts, but they are using NAT either way. See this
helpful
[blog article](https://sgryphon.gamertheory.net/2022/12/14/running-nat64-in-a-dual-stack-network/).

A specific issue is that SIP (Session Initiation Protocol for IP telephony)
will not work without provision for IPv6/IPv4 coexistence
\[[RFC6157](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc6157)\].

Although Dual-Stack provides advantages in the initial phase of
deployment, it has some disadvantages in the long run, like the
duplication of network resources and states. It also requires more IPv4
addresses, thus increasing both Capital Expenses (CAPEX) and Operating
Expenses (OPEX). To be clear, a network (whether a home network or an
office network) can today work very smoothly with every host having both
an IPv4 address and an IPv6 address, and using whichever works best for
a particular application.

### IPv6-Mostly Networks

With the standardization of
[RFC8925](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc8925) ("IPv6-Only
Preferred Option for DHCPv4") there now exists a supportable, standard
mechanism for gracefully migrating off of legacy IP while preserving
access for systems and network stacks that either do not support IPv6 or
only support classical dual-stack. (Such systems do not automatically
support the 464XLAT technique described below, or are otherwise unable
to operate without legacy IPv4 for application or internal operating
system requirements). What IPv6-mostly provides is a low risk mode of
converting legacy IPv4 or existing dual stack networks to IPv6-only in a
very measured manner. By leveraging the IPv6-only-preferred option for
legacy IPv4 (DHCP option 108) an operator is able to signal via a
network protocol that is likely already in use (DHCP for IPv4) that the
network is able to support IPv6-only mechanisms if the host is capable
of utilizing them. Conversely, if a device does not implement and
understand DHCP option 108, they happily move on with a dual-stack
IPv4/IPv6 experience, again, with no user intervention.

This methodology holds several advantages, notably the simplification of
network segments and protocol deployment. This deployment model allows
for the host stacks to "operate at their highest level of evolution"
insomuch that they are able to, and based on the signal from the DHCP
server, disable their legacy IP stack for the duration of time
communicated in the DHCP transaction. This "timed disablement"
methodology also allows for measured testing, should there be a need to
test disabling legacy IPv4 for a short period of time, and guarantee
that it will be re-enabled. Additionally, this allows for an operator to
slowly migrate off of legacy IPv4 at the pace of the evolution of the
operating systems within their operational domain and allows for the
coexistence of a wide variety of hosts on a given network segment:
IPv4-only hosts, IPv6-only hosts, and dual-stacked hosts.As operating
systems add support for DHCP option 108, reliance on legacy IPv4
naturally becomes smaller and smaller until it can eventually be
disabled or is diminished enough that it can be removed.

One operational glitch has been observed in this scenario. If a host
that supports DHCP option 108 has any kind of misconfiguration that
prevents IPv6 from working properly, it can enter a state where it
disables IPv4 but has no IPv6 connectivity either. For example, if
a host's intrinsic firewall is configured to block incoming ICMPv6
and IPv6 packets, yet the host respects option 108, it will fail
to connect to either version of IP when it encounters an IPv6-mostly
network. This misconfiguration has been observed in laptop computers
with a mandatory corporate security configuration, when they roam to
an IPv6-mostly network outside the corporate network.

Apart from this problem, controlled and deliberate migration
via IPv6-mostly allows the operating system to
decide how much or how little it can support without needing input from
the user, making the network fit the capabilities of the host, thus
lowering the risk of incompatibility (and lowering the rate of problem
reports). Like most existing IPv6-only networks, IPv6-mostly will
nevertheless require packet and DNS translation services
([discussed later](Translation%20and%20IPv4%20as%20a%20service.md)) as well as knowledge of the IPv6
prefix used for translation ([ditto](Translation%20and%20IPv4%20as%20a%20service.md)). With these
features suppported, hosts on an IPv6-mostly network will have a full
suite of capabilities.

There is a great deployment report on IPv6-mostly [at a large conference](https://nsrc.org/blog/apricot-ipv6-only).

### The need for IPv4 as a service

Globally unique IPv4 addresses are now scarce and have significant
commercial value. Indeed, even if private IPv4 addresses are used with
CGN, global IPv4 addresses for the CGN systems must be paid for by
somebody.

For this reason, when IPv6 usage exceeds a certain threshold, it may be
advantageous to start a transition to a next phase and move to a more
advanced IPv6 deployment, also referred to as IPv6-only. To be clear,
that does not mean removing access to IPv4-only resources. Some method
of access to IPv4 resources must be retained, as the primary network
infrastructure is switched from a dual stack. In effect the *application
layer* in a host will still see a dual stack environment, even if the
packets on the link are no longer a mixture of native IPv6 and native
IPv4.

Such solutions are known as "IPv4 as a Service" (IPv4aaS) and can be
used to ensure IPv4 support and coexistence when starting the IPv6-only
transition for the infrastructure. This can be a complex decision. As
mentioned in [RFC9386](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc9386),
IPv6-only is generally associated with a scope, e.g. IPv6-only overlay
or IPv6-only underlay.

"IPv6-only overlay" denotes that the overlay tunnel between the end
points of a network domain is based only on IPv6. IPv6-only overlay in a
fixed network means that IPv4 is encapsulated in IPv6 (or translated) at
least between the interfaces of the Provider Edge (PE) nodes and
Customer Edge (CE) node (or the Broadband Network Gateway (BNG)). As
further mentioned in [Tunnels](Tunnels.md), tunneling provides a way to
use an existing IPv4 infrastructure to carry IPv6 traffic. There are
also translation options described in [Translation and IPv4 as a service](Translation%20and%20IPv4%20as%20a%20service.md).
This approach with IPv6-only overlay helps to maintain compatibility
with the existing base of IPv4, but it is not a long-term solution

"IPv6-only underlay" relates to the specific domain, such as IPv6-only
access network or IPv6-only backbone network, and means that IPv6 is the
network protocol for all traffic delivery. Both the control and data
planes are IPv6-based. For example, IPv6-only underlay in fixed network
means that the underlay network protocol is only IPv6 between any
Provider Edge (PE) nodes.

To ensure IPv4 support, the concept of IPv4aaS is introduced and means
that IPv4 connection is provided by means of a coexistence mechanism,
therefore there is a combination of encapsulation/translation +
IPv6-only underlay + decapsulation/translation. IPv4aaS offers
Dual-Stack service to users and allows an ISP to run IPv6-only in the
network, typically the access network. Some network operators already
started this process, as in the case of
[T-Mobile US](https://pc.nanog.org/static/published/meetings/NANOG73/1645/20180625_Lagerholm_T-Mobile_S_Journey_To_v1.pdf),
[Reliance Jio](https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/109/materials/slides-109-v6ops-ipv6-only-adoption-challenges-and-standardization-requirements-03)
and
[EE](https://indico.uknof.org.uk/event/38/contributions/489/attachments/612/736/Nick_Heatley_EE_IPv6_UKNOF_20170119.pdf).

[RFC9313](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc9313) compares the merits
of the most common IPv6 transition solutions, i.e. 464XLAT
\[[RFC6877](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc6877)\], DS-lite
\[[RFC6333](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc6333)\], Lightweight
4over6 (lw4o6) \[[RFC7596](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc7596)\],
MAP-E \[[RFC7597](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc7597)\], and MAP-T
\[[RFC7599](https://www.rfc-editor.org/infoc/rfc7599)\].

A framework for carriers is proposed in a current draft
\[[draft-ietf-v6ops-framework-md-ipv6only-underlay](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-v6ops-framework-md-ipv6only-underlay/)\].
Customer edge routers need to support
[RFC8585](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc8585). The reader will
notice that the solutions most commonly adopted today, such as this one,
exploit both the use of tunnels (IPv4 carried over IPv6) and translation
(IPv4 re-encoded as IPv6). The following two sections separate out these
two techniques.
[3. Translation](../3.%20Coexistence%20with%20Legacy%20IPv4/Translation%20and%20IPv4%20as%20a%20service.md)\]
also gives more detail on IPv4aaS.
