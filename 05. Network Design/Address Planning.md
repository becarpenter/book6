## Address Planning

As you would expect, in IPv6 networks all nodes may have globally unique
addresses. All networks will be given at least a /64 global prefix to
operate. Carriers should deliver a shorter prefix to their subscribers
(typically in the range /48 through /56)
\[[RFC6177](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc6177)\], which allows
multiple /64 subnets within subscriber organizations or home
environments. Even a home customer can have a public network prefix to
be split into smaller networks, which is a paradigm shift from “hiding
behind NAT” on a few public IPv4 addresses (or even inside
`100.64.0.0/10` \[[RFC6598](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc6598)\]).

In IPv6 networks, it is often necessary to manage received prefixes,
even if it is done automatically by a CE router. Likewise, network
operators receive large address blocks from the RIRs and must plan their
address distribution in order to handle address blocks assigned to
customers or their own infrastructure.

For instance, we can start with a network operator. Consider a carrier
called “ISP” that received the prefix `2001:db8::/32`. It is necessary
to separate address blocks asigned for home customers, corporate
customers and for ISP's own infrastructure. First, let's see what space
is available for planning:

```
 Global ID -Subnets- -- Interface IDs --
| 32 bits | 32 bits |   64 bits         |
 2001:0db8:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000
```

The first 32 bits will remain unchanged, of course, and the last 64 bits
will always belong to the ending subnet nodes. It leaves us the 32 bits
between them to work with. Keep in mind that there is no concern about
exhaustion of IPv6 addresses(or prefixes), seeing that this single
assignment for an autonomous system (ISP) gives the equivalent of the
entire IPv4 Internet address space to work with. And this is not about
unique addresses, but /64 network prefixes! As an analogy, a /64 prefix
would be the equivalent of leasing a public IPv4 address to a single
network or subscriber. In this way, in IPv6 planning we can favor
organization and clearer management instead of saving as many addresses
as possible. On IPv6 networks it makes no sense to count unique
addresses; instead, we consider the number of available /64 prefixes.
Think of a /64 prefix as a standard unit that fits all network sizes.

Remember that our 32-bit subnet space embodies 4 billion /64 networks,
so there is room for good planning and management as there will be no
address shortage on any reasonable timescale. A good addressing plan
should always have room for future expansion and favor network
aggregation and management. (Of course, even IPv6 address space is not
infinite, but the policies applied by the various Regional Address
Registries will avoid any risk of exhaustion.) For this reason, in the
following example, we will use the technique known as **leftmost**, to
guarantee a more balanced distribution on all available space. Back to
the example, consider our 32 bits where we can use the first 4 (one
"nibble" or hexadecimal character) to assign sixteen regions, as 0 to F,
resulting in a /36 per region. A region may be a data center,
geographical area or a branching network.

```
A. Region A - Main Datacenter
B. Region B - City south
C. Region C - City north
```

So the first layer of our address plan may look like this:

```
2001:0db8:0000::/36 - Reserved
2001:0db8:1000::/36 - Reserved
2001:0db8:2000::/36 - Reserved
2001:0db8:3000::/36 - Reserved
2001:0db8:4000::/36 - Reserved
2001:0db8:5000::/36 - Reserved
2001:0db8:6000::/36 - Reserved
2001:0db8:7000::/36 - Reserved
2001:0db8:8000::/36 - Reserved
2001:0db8:9000::/36 - Reserved
2001:0db8:A000::/36 - Region A
2001:0db8:B000::/36 - Region B
2001:0db8:C000::/36 - Region C
2001:0db8:D000::/36 - Reserved
2001:0db8:E000::/36 - Reserved
2001:0db8:F000::/36 - Reserved
```

(Note: We are using uppercase characters to distinguish the locally
assigned prefixes; this breaks the usual recommendation to use
lowercase.)

Each region has functional divisions that may earn one or more address
blocks. Each division could be for instance:

1. Internal infrastructure
1. Domestic clients
1. Corporate clients Using the same logic you can split a region's /36
   into 16 /40 prefixes, so it is easier to manage. Keep in mind that it
   is possible to assign more prefixes for each one if necessary. Now
   let's see the address plan for **Region A** where we have 16 /40
   prefixes:

```
2001:0db8:A000::/40 - Corporate clients ---|
2001:0db8:A100::/40 - Corporate clients    |---> 1024 x /48 prefixes
2001:0db8:A200::/40 - Corporate clients    |
2001:0db8:A300::/40 - Corporate clients ---|
2001:0db8:A400::/40 - Internal infrastructure ---> 256 x /48 prefixes for infrastructure
2001:0db8:A500::/40 - Reserved
2001:0db8:A600::/40 - Reserved ---> 768 x /48 prefixes for expansion
2001:0db8:A700::/40 - Reserved
2001:0db8:A800::/40 - Domestic clients ---|
2001:0db8:A900::/40 - Domestic clients    | 2048 x /48 prefixes
2001:0db8:AA00::/40 - Domestic clients    | or
2001:0db8:AB00::/40 - Domestic clients    | 2001:db8:A800::/37
2001:0db8:AC00::/40 - Domestic clients    | or 
2001:0db8:AD00::/40 - Domestic clients    | 2048 x 256 x /56 prefixes
2001:0db8:AE00::/40 - Domestic clients    |
2001:0db8:AF00::/40 - Domestic clients ---|
```

As shown above, we have a good measure for corporate and home customers,
plus a room for expansion, added by a generous /40 just for internal
infrastructure. Of course, this can be changed according to needs on
each case. For example, increase the number of prefixes for corporate
clients, or take some space in infrastructure reserved part, which is
very large. Even add another entire /36 block for the same region. If
you do the math, the numbers are always very loose so that we can always
give preference to address organization, aggregation and good
management.

### Client delegations

It is recommended to delegate at least a /48 block to clients. Best
practice says that corporate clients always receive at least a /48
prefix and domestic clients receive at least a /56 prefix. Mobile access
clients may receive a single /64 (but more would be better, to allow
IPv6 "hot spots"). See below with 2 prefixes from Region A's /40 block:
a /48 assigned to a corporate customer and a /56 to a domestic customer:

1. `2001:0db8:A3CC:0000::/48` The least four Zeros shows 16 bits given
   within a /48 prefix, available to address 2^16=65536 /64 subnets.
1. `2001:0db8:ABDD:DD00::/56` The least two Zeros represent 8 bits given
   within a /56 prefix available to address 2^8=256 /64 subnets.

See that a single corporate client is up to a virtually unlimited
address space and a domestic subscriber may have 256 subnets on a home
network. Once a client leases an address block it has to split it for
given subnets inside the network. Let's take that same home customer
with the `2001:0db8:ABDD:DD00::/56` prefix and see what we can do:

```
2001:0db8:ABDD:DD00::/64 ---> Main home subnet
2001:0db8:ABDD:DD01::/64 ---> Wifi subnet
2001:0db8:ABDD:DD02::/64 ---> Wifi Guest subnet
2001:0db8:ABDD:DD(...)::/64 ---> Reserved
2001:0db8:ABDD:DDFE::/64 ---> IoT subnet
2001:0db8:ABDD:DDFF::/64 ---> VoIP subnet
```

ISP customers typically lease address blocks through **DHCPv6 prefix
delegation** \[[RFC8415](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc8415)\].
Instead of acquiring only one Internet facing address, the customer
premises router requests an entire GUA block. Once it has it, the
smaller /64 blocks are typically handled as a prefix pool, where each is
assigned to a internal subnet.
