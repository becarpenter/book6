<!-- ## Chapter X: IPv6 Diagnostic Tools -->

Effective IPv6 management and troubleshooting rely heavily on
specialized diagnostic tools. While basic network diagnostic tools such
as `ping` and `traceroute` function similarly for IPv4 and IPv6, there
are some critical nuances and additional tools tailored specifically for
IPv6.

### Basic IPv6 Tools

Common network utilities like `ping` and `traceroute` typically support
both IPv4 and IPv6. However, due to historical reasons, some operating
systems maintain separate IPv6-specific utilities such as `ping6` and
`traceroute6`. It's essential to know which version applies to your
system.

```bash
# Basic IPv6 ping
ping6 3fff:0:1::1

# IPv6 traceroute
traceroute6 3fff:0:1::1
```

### IPv6/IPv4 Translation Considerations

When using translation mechanisms like NAT64 and DNS64, traditional
tools such as traceroute or online IP checkers may report IPv4 addresses
even when testing IPv6 connectivity. Ensure proper interpretation of
these results by confirming translation configurations.

### Specialized IPv6 Tools

#### radvdump

`radvdump` is a utility designed to capture and display IPv6 Router
Advertisement messages, critical for analyzing router configurations and
detecting advertisement issues.

```bash
sudo radvdump
```

#### scapy

`scapy` is a powerful Python-based interactive packet manipulation
program that supports IPv6. It is invaluable for custom packet crafting,
network testing, and troubleshooting. Use if geared more toward tool
creation, but it provides a powerful set of features for inclusion in
custom or discipline specific tasks.

```python
from scapy.all import *
send(IPv6(dst="3fff:0:1::1")/ICMPv6EchoRequest())
```

#### pcap Tools

Packet capture tools such as `tcpdump` and Wireshark are essential for
diagnosing IPv6 connectivity issues, examining network traffic, and
verifying protocol behavior.

```bash
# Capture IPv6 traffic
sudo tcpdump -i eth0 ip6
```

Wireshark provides a graphical interface, offering detailed packet
decoding and analysis specifically optimized for IPv6.

#### Web-Based Tools

Web-based IPv6 tools provide quick diagnostics, checking IPv6
connectivity, DNS configurations, and reachability from the global
Internet.

#### mtr

`mtr` combines the functionalities of ping and traceroute into a single
tool, providing real-time statistics about network path quality and
latency, and is IPv6-aware.

```bash
mtr -6 3fff:0:1::1
```

#### IPv6 Addressing and Layer2/Layer3 Mapping Tools

IPv6Utils is a command-line utility providing several tools including
subnet generation which is useful address planning, as well as IPv4/IPv6
address translation using RFC 6052, EUI-64 decoding, Link Local
decoding. It is also available as an online service with the same
features.

`ndisc6` is a Linux package that includes useful tools for understanding and
troubleshooting NDP. In particular, the binaries `ndisc6` and `rdisc6` are used
to generate Neighbor Solicitation and Router Solicitation packets respectively
that target a specific address via a specific interface. This is useful for
forcing a Linux system to arbitrarily attempt address resolution for an IPv6
host from userspace, even when the kernel's NDP entry does not require
refreshing. The binary `ndisc6` is roughly an IPv6 equivalent to the IPv4 tool
`arping`. The `rdisc6` binary has similar functionality, but sends and receives
RS/RA messages rather than NS/NA messages. These tools can be useful if you
find yourself needing to generate an NDP message without wanting to build the
entire packet from scratch (e.g. with `scapy`), if you want a quick method to
view the contents of an NA/RA message generated by a Layer2-adjacent IPv6 host,
or simply want to cause a Layer2-adjacent host to send an NA/RA that you plan
to view using another tool like `tcpdump` or `wireshark`.

#### ASN Lookup Tools

ASN (Autonomous System Number) tools help network administrators trace
IPv6 addresses back to their originating AS, assisting in
troubleshooting, identifying routing issues, and validating BGP
configurations.

- Command-line ASN lookup:

```bash
whois -h whois.cymru.com "-v 3fff:0:1::1"
```

- Web-based ASN lookup:
  - [https://bgp.he.net](https://bgp.he.net)
  - [https://asn.cymru.com](https://asn.cymru.com)

Leveraging these IPv6-specific diagnostic tools ensures robust network
performance and efficient issue resolution in IPv6-enabled environments.
