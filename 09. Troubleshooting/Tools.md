## Tools

Basic tools like `ping` and `traceroute` work for both IPv6 and IPv4.

For historic reasons, command-line tools on some operating systems do
not support IPv6 but instead have an IPv6 counterpart (e.g., `ping6`,
`traceroute6`).

Due to IPv6/IPv4 translation, traceroute-like tools and 'what is my IP
address' tools may show an IPv4 address.
