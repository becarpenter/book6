# Troubleshooting

Basic troubleshooting of IPv6 should follow best practices of any troubleshooting methodology:

1. Observe behavior, noting the unexpected or undesirable behavior.
2. Compare against baseline (if available).
3. Document changes.
4. Make simple, single changes.
5. Repeat.

Additionally, most IPv4 troubleshooting techniques can be translated - at a high level - to IPv6, as both protocols are routed, both provide services, exist on hosts, routing devices, and may be used in-band to manage network appliances.
