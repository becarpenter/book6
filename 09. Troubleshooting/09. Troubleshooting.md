# Troubleshooting

Troubleshooting IPv6 issues involves following established best
practices used broadly in network troubleshooting methodologies:

1. **Observe Behavior:** Clearly define and document the unexpected or
   undesirable network behavior.
1. **Compare Against Baseline:** If available, compare the current state
   to a previously established and documented baseline.
1. **Document Changes:** Maintain accurate records of network
   configurations and any modifications.
1. **Make Simple, Single Changes:** Implement changes one at a time to
   isolate variables effectively.
1. **Repeat:** Continue iterating the process until the issue is
   resolved.

Due to their similarities, IPv4 troubleshooting techniques are highly
transferable to IPv6, given that both protocols are routed, support
various services, run on hosts and networking devices, and facilitate
management traffic.

## Troubleshooting Layer 2 Communications

Layer 2 troubleshooting for IPv6 involves ensuring basic connectivity at
the data link layer, including:

- **Address Resolution:** Verify the proper functioning of Neighbor
  Discovery Protocol (NDP), as IPv6 does not use ARP. Common commands
  include:

  ```bash
  # Display IPv6 neighbors
  ip -6 neigh
  ```

- **Check Link-Local Connectivity:** Confirm local communication using
  link-local addresses. This isolates problems to the local segment.

  ```bash
  # Ping using link-local addresses
  ping6 fe80::<interface-id>%<interface-name>
  ```

- **Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD):** Ensure multicast listeners are
  operational, as NDP relies heavily on multicast.

## Troubleshooting Layer 3 Communications

Layer 3 troubleshooting involves validating routing and reachability of
IPv6 networks:

- **IPv6 Routing Table:** Inspect the routing table for correct and
  complete entries.

  ```bash
  # Display IPv6 routing table
  ip -6 route
  ```

- **ICMPv6 Diagnostics:** Use ICMPv6 tools like ping6 and traceroute6 to
  verify end-to-end connectivity and path determination.

  ```bash
  ping6 2001:db8::1
  traceroute6 2001:db8::1
  ```

- **Service Availability:** Validate that network services (DNS, DHCP,
  web services) respond correctly for both IPv4 and IPv6 requests.

  ```bash
  dig A example.com
  dig AAAA example.com
  ```

- **Performance Baselines:** Continuously monitor dual-stack performance
  to detect and remediate suboptimal IPv6 connectivity.

## Happy Eyeballs Algorithm

The "Happy Eyeballs" algorithm (RFC 8305) optimizes dual-stack
experiences by dynamically choosing the protocol that provides the best
user experience:

- **Behavior Analysis:** Observe connections initiated by the
  application and verify if it appropriately falls back to IPv4 when
  IPv6 connectivity is poor or fails.
- **Timeout Adjustments:** Tune timers within applications to optimize
  the balance between IPv4 fallback speed and IPv6 preference.
- **Diagnostic Tools:** Utilize browser developer tools or packet
  captures (Wireshark, tcpdump) to monitor application behavior in
  real-time.

Effective IPv6 troubleshooting ensures that modern networks operate
efficiently, leveraging the advantages of IPv6 while maintaining a
seamless transition from IPv4.
