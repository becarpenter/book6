# IPv6 Basic Technology

The main standard for IPv6 is [RFC 8200](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc8200). Many other relevant RFCs are cited in [IPv6 node requirements](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/bcp220). Quotes from relevant RFCs are included in this chapter.

Some generic terms that should be used precisely are given in Section 2 of RFC 8200. In particular:

- Node: a device that implements IPv6

- Router: a node that forwards IPv6 packets not explicitly addressed to itself

- Host: any node that is not a router

To avoid confusion, note that a router may receive and send its own packets, and run IPv6 applications, just as a host does.

The rest of this chapter covers various basic aspects of IPv6.
