# IPv6 Basic Technology

The main standard for IPv6 is
[STD86](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/std86), currently defined by
[RFC8200](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc8200). Many other relevant
RFCs are cited in
[IPv6 node requirements (BCP 220)](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/bcp220),
although this is always slightly behind the latest RFCs. Quotes from
relevant RFCs are included in this chapter.

Some generic terms that should be used precisely are given in Section 2
of STD 86. In particular:

- Node: a device that implements IPv6

- Router: a node that forwards IPv6 packets not explicitly addressed to
  itself

- Host: any node that is not a router

To avoid confusion, note that a router may receive and send its own
packets, and run IPv6 applications, just as a host does.

The rest of this chapter covers various basic aspects of IPv6. Some
topics are very closely linked, especially address resolution and
auto-configuration, so the reader is advised to read in sequence.
