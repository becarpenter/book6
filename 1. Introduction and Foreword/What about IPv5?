## What about IPv5?

Some people ask why IPv4 went to version 6, leaping the next number. And it was nothing related to programmer's supertition where odd numbers should be beta releases. 
The answer is quite simple. The number 5 in the version field of the IP header was already assigned by what was called the Internet Stream Protocol, or ST.
It's a bit confusing, but ST, ST-2 and ST-2+ were developed as protocols for applications like voice and video that demand quality of service.
As IP runs on a “best effort” basis, ST proposal was something like ATM networks, using stateful relationships, queuing and much more. Each ST flow holds connection state and dynamic controls to ensure quality of service. 
As we can see in RFC 1190, the ST header is completely different from IPv4, but the first field where is the version number 5:
```
 0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |  ST=5 | Ver=2 | Pri |T| Bits  |           TotalBytes          |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |              HID              |        HeaderChecksum         |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                                                               |
   +-                          Timestamp                          -+
   |                                                               |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
```
As ST would be incompatible with IP, the next version number was assigned to differ it's packets. 
Since then, the number 5 was reserved for ST in the IP version field (layer 3) and protocol number (layer 4) field. The idea is that routers could differentiate packets or that IPv4 packets could carry encapsulated ST packets, where the number 5 would show up as a upper layer protocol.
Since RFC 762 we can see number 5 assigneg in "protocol numbers":
```
                 ASSIGNED INTERNET PROTOCOL NUMBERS

   In the Internet Protocol (IP) [44] there is a field to identify the
   the next level protocol.  This field is 8 bits in size.  This field
   is called Protocol in the IP header.

With number 5 in use, it would not make sense for the **next generation IP** to carry that number, so it was “skipped”. 
The number 6 would only appear designated a few years later on a “Assigned numbers” update, RFC 1700, than as "Simple Internet Protocol"(SIP).

See that they had assigned numbers for the than “competitors” of what became IPv6. Number 7 was reserved for TP/IX(RFC1475), as they expected ST version 2 would use number 6, which did not happen.
This "IPv7" proposal was announced on IETF meeting in Kobe - Japan, 1992, by IAB members. There was no consensus among IETF engineers on that time about the new protocol, and some IAB members proposed something using ISO/OSI's CLNP.
This caused some discomfort in the Internet community and became known in technical circles as the “Kobe incident”. 
Numbers 8 and 9 were used by proposals that came to be merged in the IPv6's ultimate design.
As the lowest number available after 4, and already used in by same author's SIP, number 6 was kept for the first official specification in RFC 1883.
Therefore, do not expect for IP's versions 7 or 8 in the future, not even 9 that belongs to a April fool's day joke by RFC 1606. 
ST protocols never left a experimental phase and a IP version 5 not even existed.
