## CERN and the LHC

The [CERN laboratory](https://www.cern.ch) and the [Worldwide LHC Computing Grid (WLCG)](https://home.cern/science/computing/grid) are large users of IPv6 for massive data transfers.
Some recent statistics are shown here:<img src="./CERN-IPv6-Feb24.png" alt="Graph showing 644 Gb/s">

The CERN site itself operates a classical IPv4 and IPv6 dual stack, and uses DHCPv6 for IPv6 address assignment.
