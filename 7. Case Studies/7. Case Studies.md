# Case Studies

This chapter will contain a variety of short case studies, based on real
experience, for a range of network types. It will never be complete, as
every network is slightly different, and it will evolve as time goes on.

A good set of existing case studies from ARIN members can be found in
[the ARIN blog](https://www.arin.net/blog/ipv6/).

Here is a Malaysian case study via
[APNIC](https://blog.apnic.net/2023/03/17/telekom-malaysias-ipv6-readiness-journey/).

This is an __open invitation__ to contribute a case study for this
chapter. If you have deployed an IPv6 network, please write a short
section with emphasis on what major choices you made, what worked well,
and what problems you encountered. Even a summary in one paragraph would
be helpful. Large and small enterprise networks, and large or small
carrier networks, are all of interest. It isn't necessary to identify
the particular network, if you prefer to keep that private.

If you have already published such a description, just a pointer will be
fine.
