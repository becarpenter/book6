## Security operation

A starting point for this topic is
[RFC 9099](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc9099). It discusses the
security and privacy implications of addressing mechanisms, such as
allowing (or forbidding) temporary addresses
\[[RFC8981](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc8981)\] and pseudo-random
interface identifiers
\[[RFC7217](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc7217),
[RFC7943](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc7943)\]. Address privacy is
considered further in
\[[RFC7721](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc7721)\].

[RFC 9099](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc9099) also discusses
security aspects of extension headers, the link layer, the control
plane, routing, logging, monitoring, and transition and coexistence
technologies. It covers specific considerations for enterprises, service
providers (including lawful intercept) and residential users.

A related document is
[RFC 9288](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc9288) "Recommendations on
the Filtering of IPv6 Packets Containing IPv6 Extension Headers at
Transit Routers." It is important that service providers follow these
recommendations in order to provide satisfactory end-to-end IPv6
service.
